# breakout

This is a Rust implementation of the [LearnOpenGL Breakout](https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Breakout) game.
It is intentionally written to be as similar to the LearnOpenGL C++ version as I was able to.

# Getting Started
To build and run the project Cargo and Rust is required. The easiest is just to run `cargo run --release`.
All dependencies should be handled by Cargo or included in the lib folder.
Game assets are located in the resources folder.

# Controls
- `A` moves the paddle to the left
- `D` moves the paddle to the right
- `Space` launches the ball
